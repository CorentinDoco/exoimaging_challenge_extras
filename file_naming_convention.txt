instruments = ["nirc2", "lmircam", "gpi", "sphere_irdis", "sphere_ifs"]

The files composing an ADI (3d) dataset will be named as follows (where id is an integer value):
instrument_cube_id.fits (3d array)
instrument_pa_id.fits (1d array)
instrument_psf_id.fits (2d array)
instrument_pxscale_id.fits (float value, arc/px)

Optionally, in the case of spectrally dispersed data, we will have an additional file: 
instrument_wvs_id.fits (1d array)
